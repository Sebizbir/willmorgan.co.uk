version: 0.9.0

My website, which is as finished as the plumber's kitchen.

Things I should probably do:

- [ ] Optimise those fat JPEGs.
- [ ] Add some icons for those technologies, just to be hip.
- [ ] Properly test the site in actual mobile devices
- [ ] Link off to my CV somewhere
- [ ] Minify everthing
